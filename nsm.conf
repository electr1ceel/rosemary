#--- PART I - COMPULSORY ---#

# network interface (please change the values)
# command : ls /sys/class/net
# eth0 = 1Gbps (LAN0); eth1 = 2.5Gbps (LAN1); eth2 = 2.5Gbps (WLAN)
INF_INCOMING="eth2"
INF_OUTGOING="eth1"
INF_MONITORING="eth0"

# network interface (please change the values)
INF_MONITORING_IP="192.168.0.200"
INF_NETMASK="24"
INF_GATEWAY="192.168.0.1"
INF_NAMESERVER="192.168.0.1"

# the last digital value of your INF_MONITORING_IP (please change the value)
# e.g. "192.168.68.180" is "180"
INF_MONITORING_NAT="200"

#--- PART II - OPTIONAL ---#
# CAUTION : do NOT change these values unless you know what you are doing!
#           changing the following values may custom a lot of memory and/or have a 
#           better performance, but it will also increase the CPU Utilization, beware!
#           if it consumed beyond the amount of physical memory, the system may
#           be locked up, beware!

# MAX_PENDING_PACKETS, default value is "1024", max value is "65534"
MAX_PENDING_PACKETS="2048"

# RUN_MODE can be either "autofp" or "workers", default is "autofp"
# "autofp" may create more threads while "workers" may be in better performance.
RUN_MODE="autofp"

# DETECT_PROFILE can be "low", "medium", "high" and "custom", default is "medium"
# "high" may be in better performance.
DETECT_PROFILE="high"

# DETECT_RATIO cannot be larger than "6.0" or Suricata will be broken, default is "1.0"
# Higher ratio will create more processing threads.
DETECT_RATIO="2.0"

# When DETECT_PROFILE="custom", the following value will be affected
# (in general speaking, DETECT_PROFILE = "high" is 75)
# CAUTION : it may consume a lot of physical memory (RAM)!
CUSTOM_VALUE="100"

#--- af-packet
# CAUTION : it will consume a lot of memory (RAM), make sure you have 
#           enough memory before changing this value!
# 8-Core CPU with 16 Threading (with the following settings a total of 56 packet processing threads) :
# MAX_PENDING_PACKETS="10240", RUN_MODE="autofp", DETECT_PROFILE="high", RING_SIZE="102400",
# DETECT_RATIO="1.0" for these values, you are required at least 8GB RAM for the system.
# AF_RING_SIZE default values is "2048"
AF_RING_SIZE="20480"

# AF_USE_MMAP default value is "yes" (either "yes" or "no")
AF_USE_MMAP="yes"
# AF_BUFFER_SIZE default value is "32768", max value is "1497366528"
# if using low-end network interface such as Realtek, use the max value instead
AF_BUFFER_SIZE="1497366528"
# AF_DEFRAG default is "yes" (either "yes" or "no")
AF_DEFRAG="yes"

# ==================================================================== #
#--- PART III - RESTRICTED ---#
# CAUTION : do NOT change thesee values unless you know what you are doing!
#           unsuitable values may cause problems (such as slow down) to the system

#--- app-layer
# APP_ENCRYPT_HANDLING default value is "default" 
# (selective values are "default", "bypass" and "full")
# for better performace, select "bypass"!
APP_ENCRYPT_HANDLING="bypass"

#-- flow
# FLOW_MEMCAP default value is "128mb" (it can be in kb, mb, gb)
FLOW_MEMCAP="128mb"

#-- defrag
# DEFRAG_MEMCAP default value is "32mb"
DEFRAG_MEMCAP="32mb"
# DEFRAG_MAX_FRAGS default value is "65535"
DEFRAG_MAX_FRAGS="65535"
# DEFRAG_TIMEOUT default value is "60" (better between "30" and "60")
DEFRAG_TIMEOUT="60"

#--- libhtp
# LIBHTP_REQ_BD_LIMIT and LIBHTP_RES_BD_LIMIT default value is "100kb" 
# (it can be in kb, mb, gb)
LIBHTP_REQ_BD_LIMIT="100kb"
